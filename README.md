# SpeakerClassification

Here, we perform a layer wise analysis of pre-trained End-to-End Transformer networks for speaker classification. We have analyzed the effects of taking representations from 6th,9th and 12th layer of the encoder.
We also do an analysis of different lengths of audio and how padding the input with silence gives better results on speaker classification.
